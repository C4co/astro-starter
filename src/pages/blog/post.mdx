# Typography should be easy

<div class="lead">
  Until now, trying to style an article, document, or blog post with Tailwind has been a tedious task that required a keen eye for typography and a lot of complex custom CSS.
</div>

By default, Tailwind removes all of the default browser styling from paragraphs, headings, lists and more. This ends up being really useful for building application UIs because you spend less time undoing user-agent styles, but when you really are just trying to style some content that came from a rich-text editor in a CMS or a markdown file, it can be surprising and unintuitive.

We get lots of complaints about it actually, with people regularly asking us things like:

>Why is Tailwind removing the default styles on my h1 elements? How do I disable this? What do you mean I lose all the other base styles too?

We hear you, but we're not convinced that simply disabling our base styles is what you really want. You don't want to have to remove annoying margins every time you use a `p` element in a piece of your dashboard UI. And I doubt you really want your blog posts to use the user-agent styles either â€” you want them to look awesome, not awful.

The `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin is our attempt to give you what you actually want, without any of the downsides of doing something stupid like disabling our base styles.

It adds a new `prose` class that you can slap on any block of vanilla HTML content and turn it into a beautiful, well-formatted document:

The `prose` class is just a shortcut for applying a set of useful utility classes that do the following:

- Set a sensible `max-width` on the element based on your current breakpoint
- Set reasonable `margin` and `padding` values for the content inside it
- Style headings, `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `blockquote`, and `table` elements to look good out of the box
- Make images and embedded content responsive
- Make sure `ul` and `ol` elements have `list-style` applied
- Make sure `blockquote` elements have `margin` on the left and right side
- Make sure `table` elements have `border-collapse` and `border-spacing` applied
- Make sure `img` elements have `max-width: 100%` applied so they don't overflow their containers

You can customize the `prose` class to add or remove whatever styles you want, and you can also use the underlying utility classes directly if you want to apply them to an element that isn't a `div`:
